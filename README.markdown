## Purpose

## How to Compile

Just type

Even though the documentation depends on XeTeX, the package itself works under every LaTeX engine and can be created with

    tex keyboard.dtx


## Status

This package has not yet reachead a stable status, so the user intferface may change!

### ToDo’s

* better naming convention for the keys: Based on qwerty?
